- Collect the most important dataset: truth, health and wealth

I'm purposefully adding context to the data to tell a story...

Schema:

### Health


Sleep
- bedTime                  DateTime
- wakeTime                 DateTime
- restingHeartRate         Int
- Heart Rate Variability     Int
- Respitory Rate            Float
- Body Temperature          Float
- Sleep Score (number)
- Notes (text)  
- Sleep Location
- Location Type (single select: apartment/hotel/...)
- Dreams (y/n)
- Nightmares (y/n)

I use an Oura ring to capture my sleep data.

Nutrition:

I measure my nutritional biochemistry at both a micro and macro level.
I log each of my meals throughout the day using the Levels app.
At the end of the day, I rate myself on the three levers of nutrition.

Meals


I use Levels to log my meals.


Exercise



TODO:
- Deep work hours
- time on laptop?
- Media consumption
