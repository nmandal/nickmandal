Everyone always talks about how important data is.

I want to own my data. 
I want to collect the most important dataset: my health data, my financial data, and how I spend my time.

I don't just want to collect the data, I want to have context around the data so that I can tell a story.

### Health Data

I collect health data based on the five components of my health framework: Sleep, Exercise, Nutrition, Emotional Health, and Exogenous Factors.


Sleep
- Bed Time (hh:mm)
- Wake Up Time (hh:mm)
- Resting Heart Rate (number)
- Heart Rate Variability (number)
- Respitory Rate (decimal)
- Body Temperature (decimal)
- Sleep Score (number)
- Notes (text)  
- City (text)
- Location Type (single select: apartment/hotel/...)
- Dreams (y/n)
- Nightmares (y/n)

I use an Oura ring to capture my sleep data.

Nutritional Biochemistry:

I measure my nutritional biochemistry at both a micro and macro level.
I log each of my meals throughout the day using the Levels app.
At the end of the day, I rate myself on the three levers of nutrition.

There is an even more granular level to nutrition as well. Twice a year I'll 
wear a continuous glucose monitor using Levels.

Meal
- Timestamp (hh:mm)
- Image (url)
- Caption (text)

Nutrition
- Dietary Restriction (y/n)
- Time Restriction (y/n)
- Caloric Restriction (y/n)
- Notes (text)


I use Levels to log my meals.

Exercise Physiology

Similar to how I measure nutritional biochemistry, I measure my exercise physiology on both a micro and macro level.


Exercise
- Timestamp (hh:mm)
- Type (single select)
- Mode (single select)
- Duration (hh:mm)
- Average Heart Rate (number)
- Maximum Heart Rate (number)
- Calories Burned (number)
- Notes (text)

Activity
- Calores Burned (number)
- Exercise Minutes (number)
- Stand Hours (number)
- Steps (number)
- Flights (number)
- Activity Score (number)
- Inactive Time (number)

I log exercises with my Apple Watch.

Exogenous Factors

Daily
- Tags (multi-select)
- One Line a Day (text)
- Weight (decimal)
- Restorative Time (hh:mm)
- Highlight (text)
- Highlight Accomplished (y/n)

### Time

Screen Time
- Total Phone Screen Time (hh:mm)
- Time In Social Apps (hh:mm)
- Phone Pickups (number)
- Notifications Received (number)

Media Consumption
